# Description
Note Taker is an interactive application using node.js, express.js, File System Module, and Javascript. On the main page once you click get started you will be taken to the note section of the app. You can view old notes, write and save new notes, and delete unwanted notes. Starter code was provided for the frontend, while the backend was developed using Express.js to complete api calls getting the required html/css/js files, as well as getting, and editing (post/delete) a JSON file to store the notes. The live application can be viewed [here](https://peaceful-inlet-22268.herokuapp.com/). Come check it out!
